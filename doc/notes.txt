I. Basics of GIT
 - in directory you want to track:

  >git init
  initializes the directory as a git repository [NOTE: don't ever do another init!]

  >git status
  shows you what still needs to be tracked

Use "add" command to start tracking those files (adds to staging area)
  >git add <filename> or "*" or "."

Commit will then save that state of the file with a message
  >git commit -m "message about your commit"

 To see the commit history - try:
  >git log
   --> add "--oneline" to show commits as one per line formatted

 To see differences between your last commit and current state:
 > git diff
 If you're in a clean repository with no commits needed, you can see the diff
 from the last commit using:
 > git diff HEAD~1
