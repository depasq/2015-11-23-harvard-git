I. Basics of GIT
 - in directory you want to track:

  >git init
  initializes the directory as a git repository [NOTE: don't ever do another init!]

  >git status
  shows you what still needs to be tracked

Use "add" command to start tracking those files (adds to staging area)
  >git add <filename> or "*" or "."

Commit will then save that state of the file with a message
  >git commit -m "message about your commit"
